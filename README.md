# Frame Player

A simple application to view and play image frames, created by Yusuf Emre ALBAYRAK for project HÃœMA in TEKNOFEST 2025 HYZ competition.

## Features

*   **Frame Playback**: View and play sequences of image frames.
*   **Directory Loading**: Load frames from a specified directory. The application looks for files matching the pattern `frame_*.webp`.
*   **Adjustable Speed**: Control playback speed with options ranging from 0.25x to 32x.
*   **Navigation Controls**: Easily navigate through frames using next/previous buttons and a slider.
*   **Responsive Display**: Frames are resized to fit the application window while maintaining aspect ratio.
*   **Command-line Interface**: Option to specify the frames directory directly when launching the application.

## Usage

### Running the Application

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   Python 3.x installed.
    *   
        ```bash
        pip install opencv-python Pillow
        ```
